# Giving back

**Hike** is built using open source software and libraries made by millions around the world.

When you subscribe to our **Open** plan tier on any of our apps, you are supporting open source contributors as well.

### Transparency

By the end of each quarter, a percentage of the plan profits are used to sponsor multiple projects and contributors.

Make sure to subscribe to our blog for the quarterly updates where we'll publish all the details.

### Suggestions

You know of a supercool open source project? We'd love to know more about it and include on our list!

## Configuration options

### Check

```tsx
check: boolean = false;
```

When set to `true`, it will create a check using GitHub Checks API. You can use the check to prevent merges to happen in case some license is not compliant.

### Skip

```tsx
skip: boolean = true;
```

When set to `true`, it will allow to skip a failed check when an offending license is found among the pull request changes.

### Allow

```tsx
allow: string[] = ["MIT"]
```

An array of valid [SPDX licenses or expressions](https://spdx.org/licenses/) you wish to allow in your project.

### Ignore

```tsx
ignore: string[]
```

An array of dependencies you wish to ignore when they do not comply with your `allow` rules. They must be provided exactly as they appear in any of your `package.json` files.

## Usage examples

### Allow only MIT

```yaml filename=".github/passport.yaml"
check: true
allow:
  - MIT
```

This configuration will create a failed check on the pull request that you can use to prevent collaborators to merge their changes if any of the licenses of your dependencies is not either MIT or ISC.

### Ignoring dependencies

Sometimes you don't have the time to look for an alternative or simply can't avoid using a dependency with a restricted license. For these situations, you can choose to ignore the offending dependencies by adding them to the `ignore` list:

```yaml filename=".github/passport.yaml"
check: true
allow:
  - MIT
ignore:
  - evilcorp@^11.1.0
```

Make sure to add the dependency exactly as defined in your `package.json` file.

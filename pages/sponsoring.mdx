# Sponsoring ðŸ’–

### We believe in Open Source

At **Hike**, part of our earnings made by selling our apps on the GitHub marketplace go to sponsor some of the most interesting open source projects out there.

All of our plans have an **Open** plan tier, on which 50% of the earnings is destinated to sponsoring.

As a contributor, we want you to have a say in which projects you'd like to us to invest those earnings. If you would like to suggest a project we might want to sponsor, we'd love to hear about it.

Get in touch with us at [open@hike.sh](mailto:open@hike.sh), we'll publish all the suggestions in our blog for voting.

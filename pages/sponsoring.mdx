# Giving back

**Hike** is built using open source software and libraries made by millions of people around the world.

At **Hike**, part of our earnings made by selling our apps on the GitHub marketplace go to sponsor some of the most interesting open source projects out there.

Most of our apps have an **Open** plan tier, from which 50% of the earnings is destinated to sponsoring.

As a contributor, we want you to have a say in which projects you'd like to us to invest those earnings. If you would like to suggest a project we might want to sponsor, we'd love to hear about it.

Get in touch with us at [open@hike.sh](mailto:open@hike.sh), we'll publish all the suggestions in our blog for voting.

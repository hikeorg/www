# Compass

Compass is designed to help your new team members onboard projects gradually, helping them to explore repositories in a safe way while automating big part of the code review process for the rest of the team.

## Configuration options

### Rules

```tsx
rules: Rule[] = []
```

Contains all the rules to be tested against your pull request files.

#### Match

```tsx
rules.match: string[]
```

An array of glob strings following [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch) patterns that will match against the files included in the pull request.

#### Check

```tsx
rules.check: boolean = false
```

When `true` will create a successful check when no matches are found. If any of the files matches with your globs, then a `failure` check will be created, which you can use to prevent merging the pull request.

#### Skip

```tsx
rules.skip: boolean = false
```

When the `check` configuration is set to `true`, the `skip: true` setting adds a `Skip` action to a failed check.

#### Comment

```tsx
rules.comment: string
```

Text to be used as the comment body, you can use [GitHub flavored markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown), including [emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md).

## Usage examples

### No secrets committed

```yaml
rules:
  - name: no secrets # the rule name
    check: true # this will create a failed check if any file matches
    match: # globs to check for files on the pull request
      - "**/.env"
      - "**/.env.*"
      - "**/secrets.json"
      - "**/*.pem"
    comment: |- # creates a comment on the file
      Hey there! Seems you have committed some secrets to the repository ðŸ˜±
```

This configuration will create a failed check on the pull request that you can use to prevent collaborators to merge their changes if any file exists that matches the glob patterns. It will also create a review comment on the offending file.

### Markdown comments

```yaml
rules:
  - name: graphql schema rules # the rule name
    match: # globs to check for files on the pull request
      - "**/.gql"
    comment: |- # creates a comment on the file
      :warning: Heads up!

      You have edited some graphql schema files, always take into account the following:

      **When deleting a field**
      - [ ] I've marked it as `@deprecated`
      - [ ] I've communicated the decision to the rest of the team

      **When adding new types**
      - [ ] I'm using PascalCase for type names
      - [ ] I've checked for naming collisions
```

You have full access to the [Github Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/#GitHub-flavored-markdown) rules, including [emojis](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md) ðŸ’¯!

Make sure you add some pretty looking comments!

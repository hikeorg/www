### Cut thru the noise

Knife is an app to help you label your issues and pull requests based on conditions you define.

## Configuration

```yml
# .github/knife.yml
labels:
  - name: bug
    color: red
    description: A bug
    conditions:
      body:
        - "bug"
        - "reproduce"
  - name: sponsor
    color: pink
    description: Raised by sponsor
    conditions:
      sponsor: true
  - name: urgent
    color: purple
    description: Created by the boss
    conditions:
      pr: false
      author: [theboss]
  - name: core team
    color: green
    description: Core team pull requests
    issue: false
    conditions:
      all: false
      issue: false
      files: ["packages/core/**/*"]
      author: [bob, alice]
```

##### `labels: Label[] = []`
When set to `true`, it will create a check using GitHub Checks API. You can use the check to prevent merges to happen in case some license is not compliant.

##### `color: string`
Any valid [HTML color name](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) or an hexadecimal color value, without the `#` symbol, ie: `FF0000`

##### `conditions: Conditions`
An array that contains the label name describing the conditions that need to be met in order to apply the label.

##### `all: boolean = true`
By default, `all` conditions should be met in order to apply the label. When set to `false`, the label will be applied if at least one condition is met.

##### `pr: boolean = true`
When set to `false`, the label won't be applied to pull requests.

##### `issue: boolean = true`
When set to `false`, the label won't be applied to issues.

##### `sponsor: boolean`
When set to `true`, a label will be applied if the author is currently a sponsor for the repository owning user or organization. If set to `false` the condition is ignored.

##### `files: string[]`
An array of glob strings to match against the pull request files. A label will be applied when any of the pull request files matches any of the globs. This condition only applies to pull requests. 

##### `body: string[]`
An array of text, word or phrases to be found on the issue or pull request body. A label will be applied when any of the words are found.

## Usage examples

### Label all issues or pull requests created by your team

```yml
labels:
  team:
    color: green
    conditions:
      author: [bob, alice]
```

The label `team` will be applied to any issue or pull request whose author is either `bob` or `alice`
